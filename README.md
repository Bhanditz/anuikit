# anuikit
An ui kit - styling/layout/kerning parts, widget parts, display, made of tags. I feel that my desires are *quite* reasonable.

There is nothing here at the moment.

---

Parts:

Styling
- Stylesheets
- DOM + Shadow DOM selector things
- Tree rewriting/term rewriting
- Kerning/micro layout - TeX stuff
- Constraints
- Relationships between things
- Selectors, properties etc

Tags
- Custom components
- Structure and information
- Machine exposed - eg you can get the tags that a given window is made of

Document
- Similar to tags, but more emphasis on content and less on structure
- Machine exposed
- Concept of sources, bindings, etc

Reflow/Responsive design

Hypertext
- Like HTML forms, but allows all levels/methods - eg full hypertext

Applications can be smushed together or taken apart, and can be treated as hypertext.

A display/interaction/sandbox layer, which is the 'user agent'?
